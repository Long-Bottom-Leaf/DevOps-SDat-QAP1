Workout Service

- validateWorkout()
- logWorkout()
- getAllWorkouts()
- getWorkoutsByDate()
- getWorkoutsByType()

Progress Service

- calculate:
	total workouts
	total duration
	total calories
	filter by workout type
	filter by workout date

progress service depends on workout service
use mockito here for testing
use WorkoutService as a data source
does not store any data

Goal Service

- only evaluates goals -

- register goals
- check if goal is met
- compare progress vs target

depends on progress service which does the calculations

Dependancy flow

Goal Service => Progress Service => WorkoutService
